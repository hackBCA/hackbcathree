                <p>Your challenge for the Code for Good path will be to create an app, website, game, etc. that uses gamification and/or other forms of persuasive technology to help people practice their communications skills and connect on a deeper level. Some examples of these skills are using active listening skills and asking open-ended questions; not interrupting, arguing, name calling, giving unsolicited advice, or judging. IWE will provide many examples and scenarios of bad and good communications skills.</p>

                <p>You will be guided through official Make School material with Jeremy Rossman, the co-founder of Make School, and a couple other experts from the Make School team. Together, you will go from learning the basics of Swift to building official Apple sample apps and eventually your very own app! You will learn to use real tools and technologies that today’s leading companies use to build their own iOS applications to create a unique and useful app. Again, please note that to participate, you <strong>MUST</strong> have a Mac with the latest version of Xcode already installed; the Xcode download is <strong>massive</strong> and so you must download and install it prior to arriving at hackBCA.</p>

                <p>The Web Development path will take you from zero to having a fully functional dynamic website. Throughout the Web Development path, you will learn both frontend and backend design, as well as how to interface with outside services such as Twilio to create unique and useful applications. You will learn how to use HTML and CSS to code the frontend, and Python with Flask to program the backend. If these words mean nothing to you, don’t fret! Unicorn Foundry’s co-founders Tim Lupo and Neel Patel-Shah, Jay Mo, Jared Zoneraich, and Twilio will teach you everything you need to know and more.</p>
