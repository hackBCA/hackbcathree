      <h3>Paths</h3>
      <p>Are you a beginner or in need of guidance? Paths will lead the way! At the beginning of hackBCA, you will be able to choose a path. Within each path, you will be able to attend workshops, group sessions, and be able to win prizes related to your path. More information about Paths will be provided at the event.</p>

      <h3>Scholarship Program</h3>
      <p>Our scholarship program brings high schoolers from local underserved communities to the hackathon, covering any travel costs, and provides them with a free laptop. By doing this, we hope to give these students the power to make their ideas a reality. If youâ€™re interested in bringing this program to your school, contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@hackbca.com">contact@hackBCA.com</a>.</p>
