          <div class="code-of-conduct">
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our hackathon are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
            <h4>The Quick Code</h4>
            <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any hackathon venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. hackBCA participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the hackBCA organizers.</p>
            <h4>The Not as Quick Code</h4>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackBCA organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon.</p>
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the hackBCA staff immediately. hackBCA staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts. You can also email the staff at <a href="mailto:contact@hackBCA.com">contact@hackBCA.com</a>.
            <p>hackBCA staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.</p>
            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and all hackBCA related events.</p>

            <h3>From MLH</h3>
            <p>You must comply with <a target="_blank" href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH's Code of Conduct</a> as well.</p>
            <p>From MLH:</p>
            <p>"TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.
